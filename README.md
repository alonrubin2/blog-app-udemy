# blog-app-udemy

this app is a trial app i am building to learn about react native. all styling is done by me and will be polished later.
this app is built with the help of a udemy course, but is also a chalnge for me as i'm trying to only use the course to understand new concepts, and practice my debugging skills and already-established knowledge on my own - 
i.e. - the idea is of the course, but as much as possible, the execution is mine, problem solving is mine, and again - styling is mine.
